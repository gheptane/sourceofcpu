I, Goran Dakov, Born 11 January 1983, have been baptised in Eastern Orthodox church at the age of about 10.
I wasn't told by the priest that this will make me a slave of God, and thus, i was deceived.
I withdraw my consent for the religious conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy and renounce being a slave of any God or gods.
