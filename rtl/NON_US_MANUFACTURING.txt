Please note that the memory techologies >DDR3 (socketed) and LPDDR4 2133 (soldered close to the microchip)
involve murdering traficked children raised with certain moral qualities.
The moral qualities determine which hindu "planet" the children would go when dyning and so
by knowing where they go and puting an object inside their body the chip manufacturers are able
to get 5:1 plane split which allows them to have 5x SRAM density,
As opposed to 2:1 with ordinary quantum mechanics (2 wave functions accessible through a clock splitter involving 
a piece of ferrite and two coils.)
Thus you can assume the memory cells are twice as tall as compared to the specs on the manufactring sites
for given process technology.
Thus the lower transmission speed of the cables.
Note that the USA has recently learned to split cables and cells more than 
65 ways using a subset of the "chemistry" lokas of which there are either 70
or 72.
Perhaps they make children "spirit gifted" and then put an object inside their
bodies and kill them to take the object away to produce that effect.
