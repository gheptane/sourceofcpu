Scenario for nuclear war:
1. Donald Trump Gets Elected
2. He stops funding Zelensky and vows to not protect Europe
3. Donald trump secretly instructs the EU to increase funding for Zelensky to match the previous spending levels.
4. Microsoft, having hacked all the tridents, disables them and words get out.
5. Russia uses 60% of its nukes to take out the EU and take over its former collonies. (possibly flawed)
6. The usa uses all of its nukes to incapacitate Russia and take over the world with its conventional weapons apart from China India Pakistan Iran and North Corea
7. China wouldn't strike the us, because then India and Pakistan can strike them and Israel and take over the world
8. Flaw in point 7 :-Iran and North Corea can strike India and Pakistan after they used up their nukes and establish global socialism
Thus China can strike the USA and thus the plan is flawed from USA point of view

However several years ago, Satya Nadella couldn't have anticipated the 
success if Iran and North Corea in developing nukes. Thus he could have plotted for such a plan, conspiring together with 
the Indian and Pakistani governments to take over the planet.
The resources that Satya Nadella would have used to corrupt various governments are the 
Microsoft free cash reserves, which exist only legally and have been mostly spent.
And such proliferation of AI server computers at low cost couldn't have happened without a free operating system, which allowed much cheaper tracking of users.
That's why "Microsoft Loves Linux." (Linux is a "free software" operating system)
